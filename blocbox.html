                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>I was tasked with designing Blocbox, a SaaS (Software as a Service) web application which allows people to
collect information and store it in a single place. A user would be able to create simple documents, store
images, links to websites, and collaborate with others.</p>     
              </div>
              <div class="block_cnt">
                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>Several problems exist with the current methods of saving and sharing items online and there does not
seem to be a clear consensus of a website that stands out among the rest. Many people primarily save items
as favorites on their preferred web browser because it's either the only way of saving or sharing content they
know how to use, or because they like the ease of recalling and searching bookmarks. People who primarily
save and share items on social media sites such as Facebook, Pinterest and Twitter sometimes lose track of
bookmarks, as these sites do not allow you to categorically sort your saved items. Meanwhile, sites like Box or
Dropbox are too expensive and too complex for casual needs.</p>     
              </div>
              <div class="block_cnt block_cnt1">
                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <p>Blocbox would be a website that would allow users to learn more about the product from an initial landing
                                page, then subsequently sign up and/or sign in with E-mail, Facebook and Twitter. After signing up/in, a
                                primary dashboard would display which would give users the ability to add and/or view images, links and
                                text-based documents. Additionally, users would be able to add collaborators who can view the original
                                user’s content and make edits of their own as well. Blocbox would have three pricing tiers-Free, Professional-
                                $5 per month, and Expert, $10 per month. This would satisfy the requirement of affordable pricing while also
                                differentiating the offerings, with two specific options for those who are looking for a casual experience and
                                one for the user seeking to use the site for business purposes. Above all, the site would be user-friendly and
                                easy to navigate for people of all ages.</p>

                <h2>User Survey</h2>
                <figure><img src="images/banne1.png" alt="banne1"></figure>
                
                <p>Before beginning to design the Blocbox website, I needed to create a survey and analyze the responses to 
see where the market stands now, learn more about what is frustrating users of current cloud storage sites 
(or stopping potential users from utilizing one) and then create a website that would rectify these 
shortcomings.</p>
                <div class="results">
                                    <p>The results of the survey indicated that:</p>  
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><p><strong>The majority of those surveyed (62.5%) were between the ages of 25-34.</strong> I honed in on this age bracket as I 
      began to conduct interviews and create user personas.</p></li>
                                        <li><p>25% of the respondents were teachers, 25% were students (one High School/one Graduate) and the 
      remainder work with clients (accountant, sales, metrics consultant and video editor) and find note taking 
      and file sharing beneficial.</p></li>
                                        <li><p><strong>87.5%</strong> of respondents save a link or image that interests them online in "most cases."</p></li>
                                        <li><p><strong>75% of those surveyed report that save links and images on their browser and Facebook,</strong> while 50% of 
      respondents also reported that they save on Pinterest as well.</p></li>
                                        <li><p><strong>71.5% of respondents reported that they primarily save for business purposes,</strong> while all respondents say 
      that they write and keep notes for personal reasons as well.</p></li>
                                        <li class="last"><p><strong>75% reported that they work in a collaborative environment.</strong> 50% said that they share resources and 
      collaborate sometimes and the remaining 50% responded that they do so often.</p></li>
                                        
                                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="users">
                <p>Users who primarily save and share content in their browser do so because it's either the <strong>only tool they 
                                    know how to use or because they like the 'ease of recalling and searching bookmarks."</strong> The things that they 
                                    like least about the sites that they use for storage are that <strong>it can be hard to find what they are looking for or 
                                    they lose their bookmarks</strong> because there aren't any effective methods for categorizing their saved content. 
                                    One user reported that she does not like posting things that others could see and would like the ability to 
                                    save privately.</p>
                                    <p>The respondents reported that they <strong>enjoy being able to sync to the cloud for easy access from any device, 
                                    they prefer color-coded means of marking content and they like to save on programs that they can access 
                                    from their smartphones,</strong> so these links are always available. They do not like having to pay for apps and find 
                                    that formatting isn't always the easiest or available on certain applications.</p>
                                    <p class="pad_last">It clearly seemed that users would gladly use a cloud storage site if it allowed them to categorize their 
                                    images, links and notes and save and sync their content across all of their devices. The chances would 
                                    increase significantly if it was more affordable than the competition (i.e. Box, Dropbox, Evernote, etc.)</p>

                                to music therapy, or general articles and videos for her own enjoyment. She's looking to find a central site
                                that will sync all of her saved articles, videos and notes at a low cost—under $5. She often finds that she loses
                                track of saved articles and links because she cannot organize these to her liking on these sites.<p>  
                <p class="dan">Danielle, 28, an HR Metrics Analyst in Manhattan is looking for an app that will her to streamline note—taking

                                    purposes. She is often frustrated that she ca n’t categorize links on Facebook like she can on Pinterest.

                <p>Stephen, 40, a Global History teacher in Riverhead, New York, likes to save articles and Youtube videos to

                <p>After creating user personas and analyzing survey results, I developed a list of user stories for new and returning users of the Blocbox site. After combing through the list, I identified the stories that were necessary for an MVP-these are highlighted in green-and the stories that could be explored in future iterations-these are listed in red.

The final user flow demonstrated the shared tasks that each user could take part in from the dashboard. I also created a site map that would show the overall flow of the app.

                <p>When designing the Blocbox logo, I wanted to create something simple, yet iconic, much as Apple has with their insignia, as well as Facebook and Google have with their iconic “F” and “G” logos, specifically. I settled on the rounded rectangle box, (far right,) to evoke a simple logo that “just works,” as Apple would say. I also spaced out and centered the Blocbox logo, drawing inspiration from a  style similar to Apple’s typeface to complete the logo as well. I broke the typography down as follows:</p>      
                <p>I started out with Roboto as my heading typeface and Lora as my paragraph typeface. After some experimenting, I chose to flip the two-setting Lora as the heading typeface and Roboto as the paragraph typeface. I felt that Lora did not mesh as well with a smaller character size, it felt out of place and dated, like text out of an old novel against this modern, twenty-first century heading. Once I began building the mock-ups, I noticed that Lora felt out of place entirely, so I switched to a Roboto Slab typeface for the heading. I felt that this was a better fit for the theme and identity that I was trying to evoke with Blocbox. </p>
                <p>When it came to deciding on a color scheme, I've always liked wood/faux-wood accessories (i.e. chairs, tables, my own car dashboard, etc.) and I wanted to create something that evokes a high-quality, elegant finish as these items do. I've kept the general templates the same, but created a color swatch in various shades of beige and brown, while using a dark brown color to make the text pop out. I've chosen orange to differentiate the call to action button from the other elements of the dashboard, creating a uniquely colored button, but one that is not radically different from the other shades of brown contained within the dashboard.</p>

                <p>I used Balsamiq to begin creating low fidelity wireframes for Blocbox. It was important to create a simple, yet elegant site that featured prominent, immediate calls to action, along with transparent pricing and user testimonials. After conducting preference testing on three different landing pages, the final one below on the far right was the overwhelming favorite, so I began to design around that concept. I also created mockups of the sign up and sign in flows as well. </p>     
                <p class="pad_last">Wireframes were that illustrated the dashboard experience for the user were also created. These wireframes illustrated what a user would see after first signing up, what the dashboard would look like once items were added and what the account settings page would look like. It was important to map out how the user would update their account, so that experience was accounted for in the final wireframe shown above. Now that I had the initial furniture for the site in place, I began designing the high fidelity wireframes for Blocbox.</p>

                <p class="pad_last">Next, I began designing high fidelity wireframes in Adobe Illustrator. There was only one minor change to the finalized wireframes-the features section of the landing page was changed to a horizontal orientation as opposed to the vertical orientation seen in the original wireframes. In the early stages of the design process of these wireframes, I experimented with a dashboard interface that had a horizontal navigation (seen in the final two wireframes above,) as opposed to the vertical navigation present in the initial wireframes. After conferring with my mentor, Chris, we determined that the vertical navigation was the better of the two options, because it was more user friendly and simpler than the UI for a dashboard with horizontal navigation would be. A horizontal dashboard would have required several different dropdown menu options to account for all of the actions that a user could take, which would clutter the page and increase the chances that the user may accidentally click on a link other than the one they intended.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>This was my first design project, so in addition to learning the ins and outs of the design process, I would say that the most rewarding parts of this project were learning the ropes of an agile development process, learning how to conduct user interviews and building user personas. Building this site was a great exercise in building a basic foundation of knowledge in the field of User Experience Design and I intend to keep working to increase my knowledge and skill level. </p>     
                <p>In closing, I have learned that it’s not about reinventing from a UI perspective, nor is it about what the designer thinks works best. In contrast, it’s about learning what works best for users and reiterating on designs until you can deploy a product that is accessible and as user-friendly for as many people as possible. This was a good starting point towards those goals and I look forward to applying the knowledge I’ve begun to learn here to build bigger and better applications in the future.
